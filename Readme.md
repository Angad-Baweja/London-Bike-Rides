The project involved leveraging a publicly available dataset, specifically the London Bike sharing dataset, sourced from Kaggle. To streamline the data acquisition process, the Kaggle API was utilized within the VScode integrated development environment (IDE) to programmatically download the dataset. The pandas library, a powerful data manipulation and analysis tool in Python, was employed to thoroughly investigate, evaluate, and manipulate the dataset to meet the project's requirements.

Following the data manipulation phase, the refined dataset was exported into an Excel file format, ensuring compatibility and ease of use for subsequent analysis and visualization tasks. In order to effectively convey insights and patterns inherent in the dataset, the Tableau platform was employed. Five distinct visualizations were meticulously crafted within Tableau, each tailored to represent specific aspects of the dataset. Subsequently, these visualizations were compiled into a cohesive dashboard, serving as a comprehensive interface to explore and comprehend the dataset's key findings.

Overall, the project encompassed a structured workflow involving data acquisition, data manipulation utilizing the pandas library, data export into an Excel file, and visual representation through Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities. This meticulous process allowed for a thorough analysis of the London Bike sharing dataset, yielding valuable insights presented through a user-friendly and intuitive dashboard interface.
